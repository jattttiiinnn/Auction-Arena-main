            <p> <b>Description:- </b> The 1940s Fender Telecaster, originally introduced as the "Broadcaster" in 1949, is one of the first commercially successful solid-body electric guitars and a pioneer in modern guitar design. Known for its simple yet revolutionary construction, it features a single-cutaway ash body, a bolt-on maple neck, and dual single-coil pickups, delivering a bright, twangy tone. Its durable build and versatile sound made it a favorite among country, rock, and blues musicians, solidifying its legacy as an icon in the history of electric guitars.</p>
